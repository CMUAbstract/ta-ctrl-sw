Power system flat sat test notes:

Charge time ~30min to go from 1.7V to on (it did appear to turn on at 5.33V)

Solar panel receivevs 67kLux and 1040 W/m^2 with power turned all the way down

Can't program when cap voltage is up above 5.4V...

Need to disconnect the programmig launchpad when actually running, not sure why

Even doing minimal stuff, we do discharge form 5.4V to 1.95 in ~30 minutes. This
means the device does turn off.


Mechanical notes:
Figure 8 around screws on end opposite kill switches
Loop around end of antenna **3**
Use two people pulling with tweezers to get things really tight
Double knot
Hold down antenna while cutting off excess


Extra Fireline is in the box.

Final programming procedures:
-Drain caps all of the way
-Program ctrl with dbg1 grounded
-remove power and programming pins, finally remove ground
-put kapton back in place
-tie down burn wire
-test that we still charge
-drain cap again
-drain...
-drain..
-drain.
