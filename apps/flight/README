This code operates under the assumption that the PocketQube is fully assembled;
the code will hang at several different points if the required hardware is not
present.

On the first boot the MCU activates the burn wire switch to sink current out of
the cap and through the nichrome burn wire in order to burn off fishing line
that is holding the antenna in place

This code is designed to withstand unpredictable power failures. So on every
reboot, the code performs the following:
* Initialize MCU and hardware
* Clears temporary variables
* Restores checkpoint and undo-log

The main loop of the program is as follows:

The interrupts on the uarts handle the following:
